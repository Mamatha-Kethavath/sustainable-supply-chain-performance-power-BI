# sustainable-supply-chain-performance-power-BI
This Power BI dashboard tracks supply chain sustainability metrics like carbon emissions, energy use, and waste management. Features interactive visuals, real-time KPI tracking, and drill-down analysis. Designed to help businesses achieve ESG goals. Includes Power BI file, sample data, and setup guide. 

Overview
During my AICTE internship, I developed a Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze key metrics related to sustainability in supply chain operations. This project aimed to provide actionable insights for businesses to improve their environmental, social, and economic performance while maintaining operational efficiency.

The dashboard was designed to track and monitor sustainability KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) across the supply chain, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. The project was hosted on GitHub to showcase my work, collaborate with peers, and contribute to the open-source community.



Key Features of the Dashboard


-Sustainability Metrics Tracking:

-Carbon footprint analysis (Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions).

-Energy consumption and renewable energy usage.

-Waste generation and recycling rates.

-Water usage and conservation efforts.







Supply Chain Efficiency:

-On-time delivery performance.

-Inventory turnover ratio.

-Supplier lead times and reliability.

-Social Responsibility:

-Fair labor practices and compliance.

-Diversity and inclusion metrics.

-Community engagement and impact.







Economic Performance:

-Cost savings from sustainable practices.

-ROI (Return on Investment) for green initiatives.

-Profit margins and operational costs.

-Interactive Visualizations:

-Dynamic charts (bar, line, pie, and scatter plots).

-Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

-Filters for region, supplier, product category, and time period.







Tools and Technologies Used

-Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

-Excel: For data cleaning and preprocessing.

-SQL: For querying and managing large datasets.

-GitHub: For version control, collaboration, and hosting the project repository.







Steps to Create the Dashboard


-Data Collection:

Gathered data from various sources, including ERP systems, supplier reports, and sustainability audits.

Ensured data accuracy and consistency.



-Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Used Power Query in Power BI to clean and transform raw data.

Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.



-Data Modeling:

Created relationships between different data tables (e.g., suppliers, products, and emissions data).

Defined calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).



-Dashboard Design:

Designed a user-friendly interface with a focus on sustainability themes (e.g., green and blue color schemes).

Added interactive elements like slicers, tooltips, and bookmarks.



-Deployment and Sharing:

Published the dashboard to Power BI Service for easy access.

Shared the GitHub repository with the AICTE internship team for feedback and collaboration.







Learning Outcomes

-Gained hands-on experience in data visualization and dashboard creation using Power BI.

-Improved skills in data cleaning, modeling, and analysis.

-Learned to integrate sustainability concepts with supply chain management.

-Enhanced collaboration and version control skills using GitHub.







Future Enhancements

-Integrate real-time data feeds for live monitoring.

-Add predictive analytics to forecast sustainability trends.

-Expand the dashboard to include more granular supplier-level insights.

-Incorporate machine learning models for anomaly detection and optimization.
